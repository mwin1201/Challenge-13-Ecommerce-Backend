  ## Installation
  Clone or download the repository documents onto your local machine. Then login into the MySQL shell on your computer and run 'source db/schema.sql' to create the ecommerce_db database to store the data. When that is complete log out of MySQL shell and from the command line run 'npm run seed'. This will populate your database with tables and data values to start using CRUD operations immediately using Insomnia or Postman services.

  ## Usage
